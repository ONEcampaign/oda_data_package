# ODA Data Package

## The Problem

Working with Official Development Assistance (ODA) data from the OECD DAC can be overwhelming. The data is scattered across multiple databases (DAC1, DAC2A, CRS), each with different structures and access methods. Getting the specific indicators you need requires expert knowledgeâ€”not just of ODA concepts, but also of how the DAC databases and tools are organized. You might spend hours navigating web interfaces, downloading files, and transforming data before you can even start your analysis.

This package simplifies that entire process. Whether you need total ODA flows, bilateral aid to specific countries, or detailed project-level data, you can get it with a few lines of Python code.

## What You Can Do

**Get ODA indicators with automatic filtering:**

```python
from oda_data import OECDClient, set_data_path

set_data_path("data")
client = OECDClient(years=range(2018, 2023), providers=[4, 302])  # France and USA
data = client.get_indicators("DAC1.10.1010")  # Total ODA
```

**Convert to any currency and constant prices:**

```python
client = OECDClient(
    years=range(2020, 2023),
    currency="EUR",
    base_year=2021,  # Constant 2021 prices
    measure="grant_equivalent"
)
data = client.get_indicators("DAC1.10.11015")  # Bilateral ODA
```

**Add human-readable context:**

```python
from oda_data import add_names_columns, add_sectors

data = add_names_columns(data, ["provider_code", "recipient_code"])
data = add_sectors(data)  # Add sector classifications
```

**Analyze policy markers:**

```python
from oda_data import bilateral_policy_marker

gender_data = bilateral_policy_marker(
    years=range(2015, 2023),
    marker="gender",
    marker_score="principal",
    currency="USD",
    base_year=2021
)
```

## Key Features
